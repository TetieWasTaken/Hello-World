# Hello, World!

## This repository features the famous "Hello, World!" scripts.

A "Hello, World!" program is generally a computer program that ignores any input and outputs or displays a message similar to "Hello, World!". A small piece of code in most general-purpose programming languages, this program is used to illustrate a language's basic syntax. "Hello, World!" programs are often the first a student learns to write in a given language, and they can also be used as a sanity check to ensure computer software intended to compile or run source code is correctly installed, and that its operator understands how to use it. - Wikipedia

# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this repository! Please read the following guidelines before making any contributions.

## How to Contribute

To contribute to this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository**: First, you will need to create a fork of the repository that you want to contribute to. A fork is a copy of the repository that you can use to make changes without affecting the original repository. To create a fork, click the "Fork" button on the repository page on GitHub.

2. **Clone the repository**: Next, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine. This will allow you to make changes and commit them to your local repository. To clone the repository, use the `git clone` command and specify the URL of your fork. For example: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git`

3. **Create a new branch**: It's a good practice to create a new branch for your changes. This will allow you to keep your changes separate from the main codebase and make it easier to review and merge your changes later. To create a new branch, use the `git branch` command and specify a name for the branch. For example: `git branch my-changes`

4. **Switch to the new branch**: To work on the new branch, you will need to switch to it using the `git checkout` command. For example: `git checkout my-changes`

5. **Make and commit your changes**: Now you can make changes to the code on your local machine and commit them to your local repository. Use the `git add` and `git commit` commands to stage and commit your changes. Be sure to include a detailed commit message that explains the changes you made.

6. **Push your changes to your fork**: When you are ready to share your changes, you can push them to your fork on GitHub. Use the `git push` command and specify the name of your branch. For example: `git push origin my-changes`

7. **Create a pull request**: Finally, you can create a pull request to request that your changes be merged into the original repository. A pull request is a request to merge the changes in your repository into the original repository. To create a pull request, go to the repository page on GitHub and click the "Compare & pull request" button. Follow the prompts to create and submit the pull request.

We will review your pull request and decide whether to merge the changes into the main codebase.

## Types of Contributions

We welcome the following types of contributions to this repository:

### Bugs and Issues

If you have identified a bug or an issue with the existing code, we would appreciate it if you could submit a report with the following information:

- A short summary of the issue
- The specific file(s) or code snippet(s) that are causing the issue
- A description of the expected behavior and the actual behavior you observed
- If possible, a suggested solution to the issue

Please note that we may not be able to accept every bug or issue report, but we will do our best to review and address as many as we can.

### New Scripts

We welcome submissions of new scripts that meet the following requirements:

- The script must be unique and not already exist in the repository.
- The script must output "Hello, World!" or a similar greeting to the console or any other form of display.

### Translations

We welcome translations of the "Hello, World!" script into other languages. To submit a translation, please provide the following:

- A version of the script that is written in the target language, with the greeting translated appropriately.
  = The translated greeting must be 100% correct and not generated using automated translation tools such as Google Translate.
- Please note that we are only interested in translations for languages that are not already covered in the repository.

## Submitting Contributions
